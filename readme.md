Get_next_line is a project from the second rank of the Codam curriculum. This was the second
project that I finished as a student at Codam (the first one was Libft).

### Goal of project:
*'This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection,
but it will also make you learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static
variables.'*

### Skills that I've learned / improved
- Working with a static variable
- Using the read function to read to a file or variable.
- Working with arrays (assigning memory and copying from and to arrays)

### What could be done better a next time
I'm writing this about 6 months after finishing the Get_next_line project. Looking back at my code, I feel like some things
could have been programmed more effeciently. Especially the amount of times that I assign memory, read and write to and from arrays
could be less. Also, a few functions could have been replaced by the functions that I already wrote in the Libft project. There was
no need for them to be written again. A final point is that variable names and function names could have been clearer (so that it instantly
becomes clear for someone else reading my code what a certain function or variable does).
